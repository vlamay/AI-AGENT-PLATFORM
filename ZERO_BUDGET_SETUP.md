## 📊 FREE TIER STACK (100% FREE)

### Infrastructure (Local Development)

```
Services:
├── Ollama (Local LLMs) - FREE
├── PostgreSQL (Docker) - FREE  
├── Redis (Docker) - FREE
├── Nginx - FREE
└── Prometheus + Grafana - FREE

Total Cost: $0/month

```

### Cloud Hosting (Free Tiers)

| Provider | Free Tier | Limitations |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Railway** | $5 credit/month | 500 hours compute |
| **Render** | 750 hours/mo | Auto-sleep after 15min idle |
| **Fly.io** | Scale-to-zero | 256MB RAM, 1 shared CPU |
| **Cloudflare Workers** | 100K requests/day | Perfect for API |

**Recommended**: Railway for API + Fly.io for workers

---

## 🚀 QUICK START (ZERO COST)

### Step 1: Local Setup (5 minutes)

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/vlamay/AI-AGENT-PLATFORM
cd AI-AGENT-PLATFORM

# Start everything with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# Pull Ollama models
./scripts/setup_ollama.sh

# Test
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

**Cost**: $0  
**Time**: 5 minutes

---

### Step 2: Deploy to Free Cloud (10 minutes)

#### Option A: Railway (Easiest)

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm i -g @railway/cli

# Login
railway login

# Deploy
cd AI-AGENT-PLATFORM
railway init
railway up

# Get URL
railway domain
# -> https://your-app.up.railway.app
```

**Cost**: $0 (500 hours free)  
**Monthly credit**: $5

#### Option B: Fly.io (Scale to Zero)

```bash
# Install flyctl
curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh

# Launch
fly launch --ha=false
fly deploy

# Scale to zero when idle
fly scale count 0
# Wakes up automatically on request!
```

**Cost**: $0 (wakes on demand)  
**Best for**: Low-traffic demos

---

## 💡 COST OPTIMIZATION TRICKS

### 1. Smart Model Routing

```python
# Route 90% of requests to FREE Ollama models
def route_request(query, tier="free"):
    if tier == "free":
        return use_ollama_local(query)  # $0
    elif tier == "pro":
        # 80% free, 20% paid
        if random.random() < 0.8:
            return use_ollama_local(query)  # $0
        else:
            return use_gpt4_mini(query)  # $0.15/1K
    
    return use_best_model(query)
```

### 2. Aggressive Caching

```python
# Cache common queries in Redis (free)
@cache(ttl=3600)  # 1 hour cache
def get_response(query):
    # Only call API if not cached
    return ai_router.route(query)
```

**Result**: 70% cache hit rate → 70% of requests cost $0

### 3. Batch Processing

```python
# Group 10 requests → 1 API call
batch = collect_requests(10)
response = call_api(batch)  # 10x cheaper
```
